The national flag by law is "Hinomaru", a red sun on a white background, symmetrical top to bottom as well as left to right.

The population is 127,187,000 (as of Feb 2014, by Ministry of International Affairs). The official language is Japanese.

      The current Emperor is Akihito (125th Emperor) and the Prime Minister is Shinzo Abe. Politics follow the constitution. The Emperor is a hereditary monarch and is "a symbol of Japan and a symbol of national integration by the Japanese." The constitution recognises freedom of religion and a national religion does not exist. Many do not follow any religion. According to a survey carried out by the Ministry of Education, 1,939,613 people follow Shinto, 85,138,694 people follow Buddhism, 1,908,479 people are Christian and 9,114,049 follow other religions (as of 2012). </p>
