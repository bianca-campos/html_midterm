        <p>Brazil is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the sixth-most populous. The capital is Brasília, and the most-populated city is São Paulo. It is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources. 
        Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, the official language is Portuguese, which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. The most famous exception to this is a strong sign language use in education and government services. Instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access ("inclusion") to deaf people.</p>

      <img src="images/brazilculture.png" id="brright" alt="culture" title="Brazilian Culture">
	<p>The core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire.[395] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles. The culture was, however, also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.
	Some aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of Italian, German and other European as well Japanese, Jewish and Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil during the 19th and 20th centuries.[397] The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and cuisine; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.[398]
	Brazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from Baroque (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century)[399][400] to Romanticism, Modernism, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism and Abstractionism. Brazilian cinema dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.
	The music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European and African elements.[406] Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. </p>
